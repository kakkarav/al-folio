<p>Hi there, I am Best.</p>

<p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://quantumoptics.physics.berkeley.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yao group</a> at University of California, Berkeley.
As a theoretical physicist, I study how disorders and strong interactions in superconductor can give rise to exotic phases of matter, using numerical and theoretical tools.</p>

<p>I received my undergraduate degree in physics from MIT in 2016 under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~levitov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Leonid Levitov</a>.</p>

<p>On a fun side, I truly enjoy movies, drawing, and making coffee.
I was born and raised in Bangkok, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-in-thailand" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Thailand</a>.</p>
